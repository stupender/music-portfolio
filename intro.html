    <h3>Welcome to the Course</h3>
    <p>When I began typing out this material during the lockdown in March, I was
      inspired to spread the joy of playing an instrument to as many people as
      possible. Expressing ourselves through creative outlets like music has
      never been so important or potent. No matter where you are in your musical
      journey, I hope that these exercises will be of benefit to your guitar
      playing and creativity.

      <h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
      <p>You’ll need a guitar, though you can try these exercises on almost any
        musical instrument, even your voice. It’s important to enter a creative
        space with an clear and open mind. I like to meditate for 5-10 minutes
        before I play, focusing my attention on the breath. Use whatever works
        for you. The idea is to pick up the instrument with no mental or physical
        tension. You’ll want to use either a guitar pick or your fingers to pluck
        the strings. Both are acceptable! Finally, you’ll need a tuner and a
        metronome. You can find both as free apps on your phone. I use
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tuner-lite-by-piascore/id635828559" target="_blank">Tuner Lite</a>
        and
        <a href="https://www.soundbrenner.com/themetronome/" target="_blank">Soundbrenner</a>.</p>

      <h3>Open Feedback</h3>
      <p>As we move along, feel free to send videos of yourself playing each
      exercise, as well as the assignments, and I'll send you my feedback and critique.
      Never hesitate to reach out! It is also helpful for me to have some
      feedback from you on the pacing and difficulty of material. As a sidenote,
      please do not share this material with anybody outside of the course.
      Let's dive in!<br/><br/>
