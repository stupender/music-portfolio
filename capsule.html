      <h2>CASE STUDY</h2>

    <div class="box2">
      <p>Capsule is an app based medium for artists to sell and share exclusive
        content. </p>

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>Capsule's idea came about during a brainstorming session between
        musicians, including myself. Our goal was to discuss new ways that an
        artist could monetize themselves and their content. The current
        landscape of music streaming removes any substantial revenue that an
        artist would have made through record sales. This requires us to look
        elsewhere. In our brainstorming, we realized the amount of excess
        content we all held on to was quite high. Insights into the creative
        process for example often didn't reach an audience. We no longer use
        record sleeves. It could be as simple as sharing demos that never made
        the album, or recordings of a live show. I extended the reach to my
        friends in the larger art community. Film makers, hobbyist
        photographers, beat-makers, painters, and fashion designers. There are
        steps along the way to creating a finished piece that create the world
        which your art exists. Generally, consumers only see the finished
        product. This might be content that a fan would be willing to pay extra
        money for. These conversations molded the personas for which I would
        design Capsule.</p>

      <h2>PLATFORM</h2>
      <p>When deciding on the platform for Capsule, I conducted user surveys
        and looked at current market trends. It is clear that the world is
        lunging in the direction of touch-based mobile devices and apps. Being
        encapsulated as an app best captures the feeling that I envisioned for
        Capsule. It positions itself as a forward-thinking product in an
        evolving market. I sketched out my initial ideas for the concept.</p>

      <h2>FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
      <p>Artists who I interviewed had much to say about sharing content in the
        digital era. I often heard that they wanted more control over the
        presentation of the content. Some services such as Bandcamp allow this,
        while others such as Instagram and Facebook will apply your content to
        a pre-build template. Without web development skills, some artists feel
        constrained by current services. The content became my guide. Capsule
        is designed in way which allows the artist to stay true to their vision.
        It pairs the artist with a hired designer. They will collaborate to
        create a beautiful page for the artist's content. The designer then
        receives a percentage of the payments made for the Capsule.</p>

      <h2>DESIGN</h2>
      <p>I strove to create a neutral design that would allow content to be the
        focus of the user experience. Bold typefaces and colors convey movement
        through a process or action. User testing in early prototypes helped
        refine processes such as onboarding. Users focused more when viewing
        one task at a time. If this was the case though, they wanted to be able
        to scroll back and forth between tasks. I added navigation buttons
        including arrows and a center button that fills in when a task is
        complete. A progress bar and save-warning messages are included to aid
        in user confidence.</p>

      <h2>FUTURE USE</h2>
      <p>Future uses for Capsule are wide reaching. It could remain as a app
        for exclusive content only. It could expand into a primary service by
        which artists sell their actual works of art. It is up to artists to
        create and to whether the market finds value in this. Capsule opens a
        new door to empower the arts in the digital era.</p>
