    <h3>Note Durations</h3>
    <p>If you tried to compare music with three dimensional space, you might
      think of pitch as existing on a vertical y-axis, and rhythm as existing
      on a horizantal x-axis of time. <br><br> Rhythm is essentially how pitches exist in
      relation to time! The first element to rhythmic notation is the duration of a
      note. Below we have 5 bars (the space in the staff seperated by
      vertical lines) of equal length. They're filled by notes of different durations
      that end up being equal to each other.<br/><br/>
      In the following example we're shown that 1 whole note = 2 half notes =
      4 quarter notes = 8 eigth notes = 16 sixteenth notes. They are notated in that order.</p>

  <div class="textbox">
    <h3>Dotted Rhythms</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you'll see a dot directly to the right of the written note. This means
    that you'll add half of the note's length to it. For example, a dotted quarter
    note is equal to 3 eigth notes. You add one half of the quarter note (an
    eigth note) to the length of the full quarter note (two eigth notes). In the
    following example we'll see two dotted quarter notes used to fill the final bar.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="textbox">
    <h3>Changing the Time Signature</h3>
    <p>The two numbers on the left side of the staff make up the <b>time signature</b>.
    The bottom number represents a note duration (4 = quarter, 8 = eigth, etc...),
    and the top number represents how many notes of that duration fill one bar.
    Most of our examples so far have been in 4/4, meaning there are 4 quarter notes
    in a bar. The following example shows 6/8. This means there will be 6 eigth notes
    in a bar. Here's a few of the many ways we can fill a bar of 6/8.</p>
