    <h3>How to Sit</h3>
    <p>For ideal sitting position, find a chair that allows you to sit upright
      with at a right angle between the torso and legs. Your knees will ideally
      form right angles as well. This is all to minimize any unnecessary flexing
      of the joints. You also want to keep your back upright and straight to
      avoid the tendecy to slouch over the guitar. Let the lower bout of the
      guitar rest on your right leg, so that the back of the guitar can rest
      against the torso.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="textbox">
    <h3>Hands, Wrists, and Elbows</h3>
    <p>The resting point for the fingers is in between flexing a fist, and
      extending straight outwards as though waving your hand. It’s this
      in-between neutral position that you want to keep our fingers at whenever
      possible to avoid extra tension.  By the same logic, you want to aim for
      both elbows to be at a right angle between the forearm and bicep. Finally,
      try to keep the wrist of both hands as straight as possible at any given time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="textbox">
    <h3>Being Flexible</h3>
    <p>This can be a lot to think about at first, so just remember that this is an
      “ideal posture”. Don’t let it make you feel too rigid. You want to be flexible
      and expressive when playing music. See what feels best for
      you, and know that this information is here to revisit when you need it.
