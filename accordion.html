      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>The world of boxes and clouds is one often ruled by business and
        monotony. Accordion was created in order to introduce a splash of color
        to that world. The issue that I set out to solve was one of creative
        collaboration. Many users are turned off by the idea of cloud services
        because they are often marketed for business use. These people often
        find themselves working in collaborative situations that end up in a
        mess of emails and texts. Accordion was designed to replace the
        collaborative workflow via its note taking & cloud-based server,
        keeping in mind a human element.</p>

      <h2>My Solution</h2>
      <p>Accordion’s solution is simple. A bold and colorful workflow-based
        approach to collaborative note taking for the everyday person.
        Accordion is a media-rich and responsive web app that keeps all of your
        project files and communication between collaborators within a single
        page.</p>

      <h2>UX Design Process</h2>
      <p>My process was developed through many rounds of research, prototyping,
        design, and user testing. Accordion’s branding was designed to be bold.
        A red box with bold white text. I found that many of our competitors
        used neutral branding, so I chose this as a point to stand out.
        Accordion is also highly collaborative. User surveys concluded this was
        the most sought after feature; not just a service but a workflow. I
        wanted to draw users from all backgrounds. I did this by designing a
        blog based around use of Accordion in the field. This aims to not only
        generate outside interest in Accordion, but to create a culture around
        it. Again, the goal is to humanize a web based service. In user testing,
        I had people of multiple age brackets try the product. This resulted in
        feedback that led us to make all buttons on Accordion text based (such
        as settings) and affirmed by a thick line that appears below your
        selection. In the same vein of ease-of-use, we decided   to reaffirm the
        user’s location in the Accordion folder system in both the left column
        navigation, and the right side icon view. These two mirror each other
        so as to make the user comfortable with their location within the file
        system.</p>

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p> I’m confident that Accordion could stand out on its own based on its
        own boldness and the human elements that I designed to be a part of it.
        I think in the future, making technology feel more personal and usable
        by any person or group will be important to my design process and it is
        what I felt most strongly about in designing Accordion. Furthermore, I
        wanted to create a product that made something like collaboration on a
        project actually feel fun.</p>
