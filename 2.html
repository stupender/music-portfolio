    <h3>Our Musical Pallate</h3>
    <p>Before we play anything, let’s take a look at the pallate that we’re working with.
      All of Western music is constructed by dividing the octave (the space
      between any frequency and that of twice it’s rate of vibration) into 12
      tones, or half steps. On the guitar a half step is represented by a single
      fret. On the following page we’re going to dive right in and play the
      12-Tone Chromatic Scale in 1st Position. 1st Position means that with the
      left hand we’ll use the index finger on the 1st fret, middle finger on the
      2nd fret, ring finger on the 3rd fret, & pinky on the 4th fret. Here we’ll
      find all of the notes that we need to express anything in the musical
      Universe!

    <h3>Right Hand (Picking) Technique</h3>
    <p>When playing this exercise use alternating down and then up strokes with
      the pick. If you're using the fingers, alternate between strokes of the
      index and middle fingers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="textbox">
    <h3>Left Hand Technique</h3>
    <p>Keep the left hand fingers in a position where they are
      ready to play the note that is coming next. You can almost let them
      hover over the next fret in the resting position. The tendency is often to
      pull them away from the fretboard, or let them move around in uncontrolled
      ways. You can see an example of this in the video below. We’ll explore
      this more in the upcoming lessons.</p>

    <h3>An Oberservation On Tuning</h3>
    <p>You may have noticed that we always play up to the 4th fret before
      reaching the next open string, except for on the B string. On the B
      string we play up to the 3rd fret before playing the next open string.
      This is because the interval between the B & High E strings is one half
      step lower than the interval between all other strings. This will present
      with some unique challenges down the road. Until then, just keep it in
      mind!</p>

    <h3>Assignment: Hearing First</h3>
    <p>Play a melody of your own, as simple or complex as you’d like. Try to
      really “hear” each note in your head before you try to play it on the
      guitar. If needed, sing it out first. Record this melody as a voice memo
      on your phone.</p>
