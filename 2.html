    <h3>An Oberservation On Tuning</h3>
    <p>You may have noticed that we always play up to the 4th fret before
      reaching the next open string, except for on the B string. On the B
      string we play up to the 3rd fret before playing the next open string.
      This is because the interval between the B & High E strings is one half
      step lower than the interval between all other strings. This will present
      with some unique challenges down the road. Until then, just keep it in
      mind!</p>

    <h3>Left Hand Technique</h3>
    <p>It’s important to keep left hand fingers in a position where they are
      ready to play the note that is coming up next. You can almost let them
      hover over the next fret, or at make sure they're nearby. The tendency is often to
      pull them away from the fretboard, or let them move around in uncontrolled
      ways. You can see an example of this in the provided video. We’ll explore
      this more in the upcoming lessons. </p>

    <h3>Practice: Hearing First</h3>
    <p>Play a melody of your own, as simple or complex as you’d like. Try to
      really “hear” each note in your head before you try to play it on the
      guitar. If needed, sing it out first. Record this melody as a voice memo
      on your phone.</p>
